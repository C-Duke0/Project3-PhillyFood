## Project Overview

The Philadelphia Restaurant Cuisine project aims to visualize restaurant cuisines in Philadelphia. By leveraging data from Yelp and GeoJSON, this project provides interactive maps and other charts that highlight the top cuisines in the area, allowing users to explore the culinary landscape of the city.

## Features

- Interactive map displaying the most common cuisines by zip code.
- Mouseover tooltips providing detailed information on the top three cuisines for each area.
- Color-coded legend for easy identification of cuisine types.
- Zoom functionality for in-depth exploration of specific regions.

## Data Sources

- **Yelp Academic Dataset:** Provides information on restaurants and their respective cuisines.
- **GeoJSON:** Used to define the geographical boundaries of Philadelphia's zip codes.

## Getting Started

## Ethical Considerations made: 

For the Philadelphia Food Map project,  ethical considerations were addressed to ensure responsible handling of data and interactions with the public. 

Here are some specific ethical considerations for our project:

- Privacy and Consent

We ensured that the data collected about businesses, such as addresses, ratings, or owner information, was used responsibly and in compliance with privacy laws.

We avoided capturing personal data of individuals visiting or reviewing the establishments such as posting user reviews without consent.

- Data Source Legitimacy

We verified that all data sources are legitimate and that we had the right to use the data, and we ensured compliance with terms of service for the data obtained from the third-party sources.

- Accuracy and Fairness

We have ensured that all information presented on the map is accurate and fairly represents the businesses, and have avoided any bias that could unfairly harm or benefit particular establishments.


## Interacting with the Map

- **Mouseover:** Hover over different zip codes to see the top three cuisines in that area.
- **Zoom:** Click on a zip code to zoom in and explore specific regions more closely.

## Project Structure


## Caveats

- The following zip codes showed no results in the dataset, meaning there are no restaurants listed in these areas: `19137`, `19133`, `19141`, `19109`.
