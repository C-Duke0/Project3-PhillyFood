## Project Overview

The Philadelphia Restaurant Cuisine project aims to visualize restaurant cuisines in Philadelphia. By leveraging data from Yelp and GeoJSON, this project provides interactive maps and other charts that highlight the top cuisines in the area, allowing users to explore the culinary landscape of the city.

## Features

- Interactive map displaying the most common cuisines by zip code.
- Mouseover tooltips providing detailed information on the top three cuisines for each area.
- Color-coded legend for easy identification of cuisine types.
- Zoom functionality for in-depth exploration of specific regions.

## Data Sources

- **Yelp Academic Dataset:** Provides information on restaurants and their respective cuisines.
- **GeoJSON:** Used to define the geographical boundaries of Philadelphia's zip codes.
